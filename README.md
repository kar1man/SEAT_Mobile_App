SEAT: Smart Efficient and Affordable Transit

SEAT is a mobile application designed to simplify and enhance the daily experience of commuting via Light Rail Transit (LRT). By integrating multiple essential features into a single platform, SEAT provides an all-in-one solution for managing public transportation and improving the overall travel experience.

Purpose of the App
SEAT aims to fill gaps in current transit apps by offering commuters:

- Seamless top-up functionality for transportation cards.
- Real-time train tracking to monitor arrivals and departures.
- Crowdedness information, helping users plan their trips with comfort in mind.
- Service advisories to keep users informed of disruptions or delays.
- Drop-off notifications, ensuring users don’t miss their stop.
- Unlike existing solutions that often focus solely on navigation or ticketing, SEAT combines these features to make public transportation more efficient, personalized, and financially manageable.

Features
- Train/Bus Tracker: Real-time updates on arrivals and departures.
- Transportation Card Top-ups: Easily manage and reload cards.
- Crowdedness Tracker: Check how full a train is before boarding.
- Notifications and Alerts: Stay updated on public advisories and get notified when approaching your destination.


Limitations and Disclaimer
- Please note that some features in the SEAT app may not be fully functional due to limited resources and the development team's beginner-level experience. While the app is designed to show how these features would work, certain components may not be connected to real data sources.

For example:
- Payment API: The app’s top-up functionality is implemented, but it may not be connected to a real payment gateway or API.
- Real-time tracking: Features like train arrival times and crowdedness tracking may be based on simulated or placeholder data rather than actual real-time information
  
Despite these limitations, the app demonstrates the intended functionality and user experience, serving as a proof of concept for future development and improvements.

This project is to be submitted in partial fulfillment for the subject course: Mobile Programming
